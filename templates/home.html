<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>KnownPlainText uses a database to store LM and NTLM password hashes and their associated 
plaintext equivalent. Users upload a PWDump file to the KnowPlainText server and the server 
returns the plaintext password for any hashes stored in the database. Any hashes that are 
not in the database are cracked offline and put into the database for future use. Overtime, 
as more passwords are cracked and stored in the database, only the most common passwords 
will be in the database.</p>

<h3>Why It Works</h3>
<p>It is common for a person to reuse passwords across services and it is also common for 
multiple users in a large group to use the same password. Over and over again, Internet 
password breaches have shown us that the same 100 passwords or variations of them account for 
a significant percentage of user passwords. Since password reuse is so common, it is not 
necessary to store terabytes of hash/plaintext value pairs because a small subset will yield 
significant results.</p>

<h3>Why Should I Use the Service</h3>
<p>After a pentester captures the hashes for a server or domain controller, she will typically 
use hashcat, JtR, or some form of rainbow tables to crack the passwords. At a minimum it will 
typically take 15 - 30 minutes to run a short list of potential passwords. This process may be 
repeated multiple times throughout the test, causing the pentester to spend valuable time 
cracking passwords instead of popping boxes. Since KnowPlainText stores only the most common 
password hashes it can return significant results in seconds instead of minutes or hours.</p>

<h3>How Can I Use the Service</h3>
<p>There are three ways to use KnownPlainText. One, purchase a subscription and upload the 
hashes you want cracked. Two, purchase a subscription and download the passwords to use with 
your favorite password cracking software. Third, purchase a server license and build your own 
database of password hashes.</p>
